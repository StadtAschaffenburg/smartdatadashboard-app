# SmartDataDashboard - Aschaffenburg - APP

This is the Smart Data Dashboard Aschaffenburg. It provides real time information about the climate footprint for the city of [Aschaffenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aschaffenburg). The application displays the data using different charts and a tile-based layout with separate pages for each category. The data is sourced from various providers, including the ThingsBoard Aschaffenburg, the German Weather Service (DWD), BrightSky, and other data providers.

## Getting Started

To run the application on your local machine, first clone the repository:

> > > git clone https://github.com/your-username/smartdatadashboard-ab.git
> > > cd smartdatadashboard-ab

Then, install the dependencies:

> > > npm install
> > >
> > > # or
> > >
> > > yarn install

Finally, start the development server:

> > > npm run dev
> > >
> > > # or
> > >
> > > yarn dev

You should now be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Hosting

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run start`

Bind the port (e. g. 3000) to your domain (nginx: `proxy_pass`). Make sure to restart the process after you update the app.

## Content Management

The app uses a static file cache to store any external content. This is a simple yet effective way to avoid unnecessary API calls. There are three stages stages:

1. Deliver the corresponding file from the cache.
2. If the cache is empty: fetch it from the CMS system and store it in the cache.
3. If the CMS can't deliver the requested file: fetch it from the fallback folder (last completed response).

After updating the CMS the cache folder (`/assets/cache/content`) needs to be flushed. Just call the following hook: `/api/flush?secret=[NEXT_PUBLIC_FLUSH_SECRET]`
